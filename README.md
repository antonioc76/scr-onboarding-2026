Introduction:

This is a proposal for the 2025 SCR onboarding program. This program is intended to facilitate an introduction to SCR, its members, the tools utilized, and the skills that can be learned and practiced in the organization. In addition to this, the onboarding should serve as a fun, interactive, social activity for new members to form connections and enjoy themselves. To accomplish these goals, the onboarding program is an interdisciplinary robotics challenge meant for teams of 3 (mechanical, electrical, software). At first, each member should have a task to complete in parallel with the other members on their teams. Then, there will be a blocking task that requires collaboration or combination of multiple disciplines to complete. 

Mentorship:
Mentors should provide an introduction to the challenge and suggested tools, as well as staggered assistance, both to all teams and individually. Time and opportunity for teams to work through challenges on their own or collaboratively with each other should also be provided. 

The Delivery Bot Challenge:

Teams of 3 (1 mechanical, 1 electrical, 1 software) will need to build a robot that delivers a payload from their location to another teams location in the onboarding room. These teams will be provided with a 4 wheeled robot without the capability of carrying the payload. The first tasks are as follows:

Mechanical: 
    Use onshape to design a bucket to carry the payload. Payload dimensions will be given. Instructions for designing simple parts in onshape and 3d printing them with the Bambu will be provided. 

Electrical:
    Use Arduino to program a microcontroller to drive the motors of the robot. General instructions for installing Arduino, and a tutorial on driving the provided motors over pwm will be provided. Skeleton code can be provided after a certain point during the onboarding. 

Software:
    Use LCM to request payload specifications and delivery instructions from a networked peer. These instructions will tell the requesting team who to deliver their payload to. The payload specifications will instruct them to design an SCR gear with their team's names on one face, and the names of the destination team's members on the other. General instructions for installing and using LCM, and a tutorial on pub/sub will be provided. Skeleton code can be provided after a certain point during the onboarding.

After the initial phase of the project has been completed, teams will know that they need to design an SCR gear with two lists of names. 

Mechanical: 
    Design the gear with all names in onshape. Instructions for embossing can be provided after a certain point.

Electrical: 
    Use Arduino to program a microcontroller to drive the robot from the starting location to the destination teams location. Mentors can provide guidance on potential strategies here.
